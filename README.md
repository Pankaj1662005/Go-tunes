## 📖 Story Behind GO Tunes

I created **GO Tunes** because I was frustrated with most music players being overloaded with ads and poor performance. I wanted a music app that was clean, ad-free, and fully focused on delivering high-quality audio.

This app ensures:

- 🎵 **All liked songs are downloaded locally**, so you can enjoy them offline.
- 🔊 **High-resolution audio playback** with **zero distortion**, even at full volume.
- 💡 **Bug-free experience** – I’ve focused on both **functionality** and a **complete dark UI**.
- 🛠️ If you find any issues, feel free to report them – I'm committed to making this app better.
