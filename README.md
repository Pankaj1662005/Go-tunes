### 📝 Notes:
- You’ll want to update the GitHub links (`yourusername/go-tunes`) once the project is pushed to GitHub.
- If you plan to share this on GitHub, you can embed public links instead of local ones (like uploading your video to YouTube or screenshots to an image hosting service).

Let me know if you'd like a lighter version or if you're planning to publish this to GitHub so I can adjust the links accordingly.
